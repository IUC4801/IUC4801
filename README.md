### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643515254/12765/meow_happy_paws.png" width="22"/>
 
 I'm [**Ayushi**](https://ayushi-chaudhuri-portfolio.vercel.app/), a software engineer from Bangalore, India.

 I currently work as a software engineer at [**@Microsoft**](https://github.com/microsoft), where I work on AI Agents and build and ship new features to an internal tool, used by millions of tenants.
 
 I previously interned and worked as a software engineer at [**@Adobe**](https://github.com/adobe), where I have built new features and optimized performance of Adobe Illustrator.
 
I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products, and I've worked on both industry-leading services and applications with over 100M+ installations. I've helped deploy key features and automate processes in high-traffic customer-facing applications.
 
 Outside of work, I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity. I spent most of my time participating in CTFs, practicing my skills in [**TryHackMe**](https://tryhackme.com/p/IUC08) and [**HackTheBox**](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and working on research topics on Cybersecurity with the application of AI. I love to sing and play guitar.
